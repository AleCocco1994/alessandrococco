I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in [Umberto Saetti](https://umbertosaetti.com/)'s research group at the [University of Maryland](https://umd.edu/), specifically at the [Alfred Gessow Rotorcraft Center](http://www.agrc.umd.edu/), starting in March 2023. I earned a Master's degree in Aeronautical Engineering in 2019 and completed my Ph.D. with Honors in January 2023 at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/). Additionally, I obtained a piano degree in 2019 from the [Milan Conservatory](https://www.consmilano.it/).
My primary research areas include tiltrotor whirl flutter, comprehensive helicopter analysis, multibody dynamics, vortex particle aerodynamics methods, and adverse pilot-rotorcraft couplings.
During my Ph.D., I actively participated in several noteworthy projects. These included the [ATTILA](https://www.attila-project.eu/) Clean Sky project, which focused on developing a wind tunnel testbed to study tiltrotor whirl-flutter stability, the [FORMOSA](https://www.formosa-project.eu/) project, aimed at designing an innovative control surface for the NextGen civil tiltrotor, and the Flapping Wing ESA project, which explored the feasibility of using a flapping wing vehicle for planetary exploration on Mars and Venus.
I am also a dedicated developer of the open-source aerodynamics code known as [DUST](https://public.gitlab.polimi.it/DAER/dust). 
To date, I have published six journal papers and twenty conference papers. In 2022, I received the second prize for the [best student paper](https://www.aero.polimi.it/it/magazine/asme-idetc-msndc-alessandro-cocco-awarded-second-best-student-paper) at the ASME conference held in St. Louis, Missouri.
